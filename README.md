# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Steps followed in the preparation of tidy Dataset

* Download the zip folder containing the train, test, features, activity_labels files.

* Set the working directory

* Import the feature names and activity labels

* Combine the train, subject_train, train_labels datasets to form Train datset

* Same procedure is followed even for the Test dataset

* Combine both Train and Test datasets to form fullDataset

* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

* Convert Subject into factor variable

* creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* The tidy dataset is submitted in the form of text file.

* The script is stored as run_analysis.R file
