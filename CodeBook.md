In the above variables "t" stands for time taken, f- stands for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) signals

e.g:- tBodyAccMeanX stands for mean of time taken for Body Acceleration measurement.
      fBodyAccMeanX stands for mean of fourier transform signals of Body Acceleration measurement.


## Activity Labels

* WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
* STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
* LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test


## Transformations

* The Subject variable has been converted into factor variable as it has fixed values, i.e.,(1-30).

* Measurement variable names have been edited to create a compatible variable name.

* Activity Labels has been used to give description of their activity.
